      Paradiso is the equivalent of heaven but it references space. It is also a representation of the old geocentric model of space. Each sphere of heaven represents a planet It is described as blindingly bright as God sheds light onto heaven.

      </p>
        <h2> Moon </h2>

      <p class="one">
      The souls who dwell here practice the belief on the inconstant. The souls who were always in constant motion get to live on the moon. People who gave up their vows for a good cause end up here.

      </p>
        <h2> Mercury </h2>
      <p class="one">
      Mercury, the second sphere, is the closest planet to the sun so the souls that were ambitious in their life get to live on Mercury. The sun also represents God, as the light of the ambitious pales in comparison to the glory of god just as Mercury pales in size compared to the sun.

      </p>
        <h2> Venus </h2>
      <p class="one">
      The third sphere, Venus, is home to lovers as Venus is the god of love in the roman mythos.

      </p>
        <h2> The Sun </h2>
      <p class="one">
      The fourth sphere is the sun which does not make a lot of sense but just roll with it. The sun is home to the wise and holds twelve souls of people who helped intellectually illuminate the world. 


      </p>
      <h2> Mars </h2>
        <p class="one">
        The fifth sphere is Mars and houses “Warriors of Faith” or people who died in battle in the name of god. It contains these people because Mars in Roman mythology is the god of war.


          <p>
      <h2> Jupiter </h2>
        <p class="one">

        </p>
      <h2> The Fixed Stars</h2>
      <p class="one">
      Fixed stars was the name for all the stars that seemed to not move and served as the outermost layer of the universe in a geocentric model. Various important christian individuals reside here like Saint Peter, The Virgin Mary, and Adam. The people here are the holiest of all people except for Jesus

        </p>
      <h2> The Primum Mobile </h2>
